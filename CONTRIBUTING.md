## Basic Formatting

* Comment as much as possible, making it easy for people,e to be able to understand what is going on. (Comment with ')
* **Important:** when using quotation marks, these will not appear in the console/document you are printing to due to the way VB works. Instead type something like Console.Writeline(Chr(34) & "text" & Chr(34)). This would display "text".
* Please have a basic understanding of VB before doing anything.
* Imports System.Console is on, which means you do not have to put "console" before everything
* Please download VB, and make pull requests from your computer, it modifies quite a few other files, and just changing module1.VB will make the program fail.
